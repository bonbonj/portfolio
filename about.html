There will be a design philosophy assessment to be completed by each participant before the first day of the class. This design philosophy assessment will be used to identify what participants’ personal design style is and how they think about design. This quiz will be useful in understanding the strengths that they bring to the team when designing solutions to problems. Sample questions can be found below and participants are asked to rank how much they agree with the statement on a scale of 1 - 5 (1 being the lowest i.e. does not agree at all and 5 being the highest i.e. agrees very much).
