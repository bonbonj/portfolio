I am a first-year master student with dual degrees in UX Design and Design Science. I speak multiple design languages, from UX design to engineering, to solve complex problems. I am familiar with the product development process and have worked with many engineers and marketing professionals on the project. Therefore, I speak various design languages and understand how to convey them to my audience and teammates.
